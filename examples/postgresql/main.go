	// This is a placeholder function to demonstrate the structure
	// Actual implementation would involve creating a pipeline with readers, transforms, and writers

	// 1. Create a CSV reader
	// 2. Transform data as needed (e.g., field selection, renaming)
	// 3. Write to PostgreSQL using a configured writer
	// 4. Handle errors and logging appropriately

	// Note: Actual implementation details would depend on the specific requirements and data structure
